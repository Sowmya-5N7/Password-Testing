## Overview
This project demonstrates:
-  How password complexity affects security.
-  Real-world testing using [Passwordmeter.com](https://passwordmeter.com)
-  Analysis of different attack methods
-  Data-backed recommendations for creating strong passwords

## Tested Examples
| Password           | Feedback     | Security Level |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------|
|letmein             |Very weak     |Dangerous       |
|Football2023        | Weak         |Weak            |

|4@vH9&kQ#mP7!sD2@   |Very Strong   |Maximum         |

## Best Practices
1. Minimum 12 characters
2. Use password managers
3. Enable 2FA
4. Avoid:
-  Dictionary words
-  Sequential patterns
-  Personal Information

## Common Attacks
-  Brute Force
-  Dictionary
-  Rainbow Tables

## Recommendations
-  Use password managers to generate/store complex passwords.
-  Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available.
-  Never reuse passwords across accounts.
-  Change passwords after security breaches.
